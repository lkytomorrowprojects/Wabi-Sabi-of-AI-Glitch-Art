# Wabi-Sabi-of-AI-Glitch-Art
Wabi-Sabi is an aesthetic of incompleteness—one that celebrates irregularities, asymmetries, and the quiet dignity of decay. In the same way that a weathered teacup, its cracks traced with golden Kintsugi (金継ぎ), holds more depth than an unblemished vessel, AI glitch art invites us to appreciate the fractured and distorted.
